# Blender 2.80beta Render Buttons
The render buttons in the 2.80beta release of Blender are gone and people were asking about them, because they're used to it and moving the mouse all the way to the Render menu is probably too time consuming.

This Add-on adds Render Buttons to *Output* tab in the *Properties* window.

You can change whether the rendered image will appear in a new window or in the image editor via menu *Render > Display Mode >*.
